# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In today's fast-paced world with rapid tech changes and a job market that keeps evolving, recent graduates face a tough challenge moving from school to work. The Graduates Job Portal project was born out of a need to help graduates connect with employers. Many grads struggle to find good jobs right after school because they lack experience and professional networks.

The idea for the Graduates Job Portal came from noticing the gap between what new grads want and what employers are looking for. A lot of grads are caught in a tough spot where they need experience to get a job but need a job to gain experience. This reality, along with the frustration and untapped talents of many graduates, inspired this project.

Creating a dedicated platform for graduates was motivated by a desire to tackle this common issue in a systematic way. Stats show that a significant number of recent grads face long periods of unemployment or not getting jobs that match their qualifications. The goal of the Graduates Job Portal is to change this pattern by giving employers an easy way to discover hidden talent and letting graduates showcase their skills and potential.

You should rationalize the choices you made in designing your application.

# Database Design <a name="database_design"></a>
